# JuhRadial MX - Restart logid on Logitech device reconnect
#
# Triggered by udev when a Logitech HID device appears (e.g. mouse
# switching back via Easy-Switch). logid only scans for devices at
# startup, so it must be restarted to pick up newly connected mice.
#
# A 2-second delay avoids restarting logid multiple times when the
# Bolt receiver enumerates several sub-devices in quick succession.
